### How blite used IPFS?

Blite has used the IPFS underpinning technology to store the details of each blite as well as the photos associated with each blite in a decentralised, censorship-free, and easily accessible manner.

Blite has used the service of web3.storage to interact with the IPFS, we make a directory of the details.json which contains the details of blite along with the path of the image attached to it.

The code for this part is written in src/utils/index.js
